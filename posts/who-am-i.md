I will go straight to the point. I am a writer, born and raised in the Warm Heart of Africa, Malawi üá≤üáº. Professionally, I am a Software Developer. That is pretty much all there is to know about me. Yes, I write code and I write stories. In short, I spend most of my time on the computer.

### The Brand
The *Malawian Writer* brand is all about reviewing stories no matter the format that story is delivered. Whether it's a song, poem, short story, movie, best believe I will cover it. Obviously I will put more focus on the literary side of things. I plan on making this brand grow.

I am also a writer and therefore, will share my experiences as a writer. I have written a lot over the years and I am ready to share it to the world.

Don't get me wrong, I am not an expert at the craft but I am willing to learn and as life as taught me, that if you want to master something, then I should try teaching/sharing it with someone else.

### Purpose

I believe that we all come into this earth to fulfill a purpose. What varies, however, from person to person are the number of things that one must achieve in his or her lifetime. I, for one, without a doubt, believe that I was meant to write. Being an introvert, words (ironically) are the only way I can express myself. They keep me sane and help me share my views openly without the fear of being judged or laughed at. I mean, if someone laughs at my writing skills in the comfort of their home, that is really not my business.

My purpose is to write. Whether it's writing code or just a 3 stanza poem, I believe I was meant to write. There are many times where I have asked myself that if not this, then what would have I been doing? Sure, I was great at Geography back in school (this feels so good to write, stay in school kids) but I have never considered it as a career path for me.

This website will show you the true me, unfiltered, when it comes to the craft of writing.

### How I Got Into Stories

Well, while growing up, I was surrounded by a reasonable amount of books and people who loved to read. I remember my sisters reading novels while other family members were watching TV. I remember, growing up, I would see people reading books in the minibus on their way to school or work. It was normal then.

My mother also bought me short story books and some novellas from time to time but the 10 year old me could not handle them and I was less appreciative then. But sometimes, when playtime got boring for me, I would pick up a book and *try* to read them. I never finished them but at least I invested in them. This to me was the beginning.

My turning point, however, came when I was at William Murray Secondary School. It is a boarding school and there was not much to do for fun then, besides books. Well, at least for me. I would then spend most of my time reading in the library. I don't know how it is now but during my time, man, there were not that many fun books.

*Most* of the books were literally classics and were put there to educate rather than entertain. It was not a bad thing. I got introduced to *Great Expectations* which I never finished, but loved. I got to read *The Diary of Anne Frank*, *Into The Wild*, *Little House on the Prairie*, and other classics I am sure I have just forgotten.

However, I was lucky to find *The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy* and its sequel which I dearly loved! Those were defining times for me.

Every thing changed, when I read *Harry Potter and The Sorcer's Stone*. My experience after I read that book and the rest of the series, is what truly made who I am today as a writer and as a reader. This deserves a dedicated blog post of it own. In the mean time, get to know me more.

### Likes

First and foremost, I like my mothers cooking. Other than that,
1. Video Games. I don't need to explain this.
2. Rap Music. This is the most creative genre there is for me. Nothing comes close and besides, Rap stands for: **Rhythm and Poetry**.
3. I enjoy being alone... most of the time.
4. Movies and TV Series. Mostly series but as a writer, expect me to tackle both of these
5. Cooking. Yes, yes. I do enjoy cooking

### Hobbies
1. Writing
2. Coding
3. Graphic Designing

Fro some reason that felt like I am adding something on my resume. But yeah that what I mostly spend my free time on.

Now on to the book side of things

### Favorite Genres
1. Fantasy, without a doubt is my favorite. I love this mostly because there is variety. When you read one fantasy story you have barely scratched the surface, but when you read one thriller or mystery novel, there's a chance that after you read 3 or 4 more, you will start to see a pattern. 
2. Horror/Psychological Horror.
3. Mysteries. I love a good mystery. Not much to say here
4. Thrillers

### Top 5 Current Favorite Books
1. *The Shining* by Stephen King
2. *The Street Lawyer* by John Grisham
3. *Shadow of the Wind* by Carlos Ruiz Zaf√≥n
4. *The Blade Itself* by Joe Abercrombie
5. *Misery* by Stephen King


### Top 5 Current Favorite Writers
Before you get to criticize me and my taste, I just want to say that Western/Eastern Books are more accessible than African Books. Just saying ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. Stephen King
2. Joe Abercrombie
3. J.K. Rowling
4. John Grisham
5. I have been reading his books recently and I love his clean, and simple writing, Brandon Sanderson
