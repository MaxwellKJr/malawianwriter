# The Malawian Writer Website

## Simple And Straight to the Point
---
The Malawian Writer Website is a markdown driven site built with Next.js 13 and TypeScript
### To Get Started
#### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaxwellKJr/malawianwriter.git
```

#### 2. Cd into malawianwriter/ folder

```bash
cd malawianwriter
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
