Walls have ears
I have known this for a while;
These walls are invisible at times
Just like hidden rhymes;
I caught my neighbors pointing at me
Our house was fenced yet I had no privacy;
I was a topic in their gossip
The topic pick in a trending magazine
The top peek of a mountain not wanting to be seen
I was the pizza topping with a juicy story attached to me
I almost snapped; I wish I was more keen
These walls had betrayed me
