PARANOIA
I wake up in the middle of the night
Filled with fear like a hyena in the moonlight
Paranoia is slowly eating me up
My actions brought me here
Truly, I am filled with fear
My tears are no longer of regret
*MY TEARS ARE NO LONGER OF REGRET ðŸ’”*
My husbandâ€™s silence on the issue
Brings a lot of fear and stress
I can smell my own death
Dreams and nightmares of a knife through my neck
