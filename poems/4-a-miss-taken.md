I had everything I ever wanted  
But only for a moment  
God giveth  
And God taketh away  
It’s hard going through this long winter  
With this unhealing splinter

I had everything I ever wanted  
But only for a moment  
What has followed has been nothing but torment  
I hit the jackpot and somehow lost the token  
I suffocate and choke on my own breath  
I’m broken and he is not shaken  
I wish I had accepted his friend 18 years ago  
Before I had made a choice that will forever leave me, a miss taken, mistaken
