You ask me why I have come alone  
And you say that my actions are unusual  
Aren’t you supposed to expect the unusual in here?  
Isn’t this a place for the queer?  
The lonely and scared?  
The heartbroken and scarred?  
A place for those who fail to dare  
The depression they are facing  
The ones who left the dreams they were chasing?  
And decided to conquer their nightmares  
I know this is not a place of confusion  
Nor is this an illusion  
Because if it was, I wouldn’t have come to this Mental Institution
