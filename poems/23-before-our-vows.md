My heart was glad that I found you  
It sang day in and day out  
It gave praise to The Almighty for the things He had done  
Without a doubt my heart was at peace  
As it heard the sound of your voice  
As you often changed your tone from high to low  
Telling me, “Max, you are not alone”  
My heart was grateful for I used my head when I made the choice  
Of pursing you and welcoming you in my life  
There was still a long way before I had to make you my wife  
But Christ said “Tomorrow has its own worries”  
So, I focused on the present and what we had then  
My heart continued to get closer and closer to yours  
Slowly making a bond  
A bond that was much greater than wedlock  
A bond that would have stood to see your wrinkled face and facials  
When your breasts will be mellow  
Indeed, my heart was glad that I was friends with you
