There I was, with nothing but gratitude  
The bond between us was comparable to longitudes and latitudes  
Complicated, but that of highest magnitude  
We started slow then we picked the altitude  
I had to struggle dealing with his attitude  
What’s funny is that he thought I was being rude when I told him, “Don’t be rude”  
Two years and counting without the need for sex or shameful nudes  
Love is a beautiful thing, I can’t be fooled  
Love is the one thing I wasn’t schooled  
By instinct, I did my best to help him through  
I did my best to see his smile come through  
He is the man in me and forever will be  
He is my love for writing poetry  
He taught me what it means to be caring  
I fell deeper in love with him with the secrets we were sharing  
With all the “Truth or Daring”,  
The long walks and face to face staring  
If he was still perfect, I wouldn’t think about whoring  
Thank God, I am here, writing a different story  
I would thank God more if my man no longer ignored me  
If he stopped with the flirting  
I pray he also changes his habit  
Of letting me know that he is cheating  
Sometimes I feel like my prayers are too much to ask  
Too unrealistic to be answered, because to be honest…
