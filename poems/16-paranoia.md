I wake up in the middle of the night  
Filled with fear like a hyena in the moonlight  
Paranoia is slowly eating me up  
My actions brought me here  
Truly, I am filled with fear  
My tears are no longer of regret  
_MY TEARS ARE NO LONGER OF REGRET ðŸ’”_  
My husbandâ€™s silence on the issue  
Brings a lot of fear and stress  
I can smell my own death  
Dreams and nightmares of a knife through my neck
