You asked if I tried something else to deal with my pain?  
I tried praying and fasting  
But some prayers are answered when one is dead  
I tried talking to his friends but they only wanted to take advantage of me  
His family stopped liking me  
I assume, they were getting a different story

For hours I would think of ways to get back at him  
I thought of killing myself  
But he wouldn’t care if I died  
That’s how heartless he is  
As my depression feasted on me  
He feasted on my misery

For hours, I thought of ways of getting back at him  
I thought of killing him instead  
You know? Put some extra spice in his bread  
Something to turn his face red  
But what if that’s what he wanted?  
To get away from me without even trying

For hours, I thought of ways of dealing with my pain  
I thought of doing what he did  
Going out and coming home late  
Well, I left one morning, and I ended up here instead
