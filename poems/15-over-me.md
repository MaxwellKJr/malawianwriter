One morning he was all over me  
The next he was over me  
A man is supposed to be angry and react to nonsense  
From him, I expected a thunderstorm  
For some reason it was calm  
I never understood him  
I would bring up the issue myself so that we could talk about it  
And every time I did, he would say, “First Corinthians chapter 13”  
And those words would hurt me  
I apologized and was slowly filled with envy  
When he would take the kids out for dinner and leave me  
I apologized and realized I had hurt him  
But the scar that I had caused was too deep  
I told my friends about it and they rebuked me  
I told my friends about my husband’s change in character  
And they said he had every right to be angry  
I started losing it when he no longer touched me
