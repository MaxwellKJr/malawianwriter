Let me tell you about my husband
Loving, caring, lovable
And the cause of my depression
He is the true Israelite in my life

The burden in my strife
The idiot I let into my life
He is great with the kids
And every other chick

I never even knew that he also liked them thick
He is not only my man
But Caroline’s too
He is very well known at my church’s Women’s Group

He was never like this though
One morning he was all over me
Next morning, he was over me
