Let me tell you about my husband  
Loving, caring, lovable  
And the cause of my depression  
He is the true Israelite in my life

The burden in my strife  
The idiot I let into my life  
He is great with the kids  
And every other chick

I never even knew that he also liked them thick  
He is not only my man  
But Caroline’s too  
He is very well known at my church’s Women’s Group

He was never like this though  
One morning he was all over me  
Next morning, he was over me
