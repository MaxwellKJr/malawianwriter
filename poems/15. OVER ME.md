One morning he was all over me
The next he was over me
A man is supposed to be angry and react to nonsense
From him, I expected a thunderstorm
For some reason it was calm
I never understood him
I would bring up the issue myself so that we could talk about it
And every time I did, he would say, “First Corinthians chapter 13”
And those words would hurt me
I apologized and was slowly filled with envy
When he would take the kids out for dinner and leave me
I apologized and realized I had hurt him
But the scar that I had caused was too deep
I told my friends about it and they rebuked me
I told my friends about my husband’s change in character
And they said he had every right to be angry
I started losing it when he no longer touched me
