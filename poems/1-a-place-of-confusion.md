You ask me why I have come alone
And you say that my actions are unusual
Aren’t you supposed to expect the unusual in here?
Isn’t this a place for the queer?
The lonely and scared?
The heartbroken and scarred?
A place for those who fail to dare
The depression they are facing
The ones who left the dreams they were chasing?
And decided to conquer their nightmares
I know this is not a place of confusion
Nor is this an illusion
Because if it was, I wouldn’t have come to this Mental Institution
