I could not stand you  
That is why I kept my distance from you  
My silence was a way to keep myself calm  
A way of protecting you from my palm  
But I cannot be that cruel  
I needed a way of dealing with the pain  
And like a monk sworn into silence, I chose silence  
My silence was better than verbally abusing you  
Little did I know, my silence would bring out the madness in you
