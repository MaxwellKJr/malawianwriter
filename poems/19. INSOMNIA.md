Staring at blank walls
Sitting on the floor
In a dark hall,
Sitting in the living room throughout winter and fall
Watching my favorite shows
Without knowing whatâ€™s going on
My kids staring at me from afar
They could not recognize me at all
Because of my short falls
I could not perform at work
My lack of sleep drained me
I had to make some phone calls
First came the paranoia
Now aging with my insomnia
