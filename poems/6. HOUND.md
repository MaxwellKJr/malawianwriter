Will this stop you from being proud?
Your words will not silence me this time around
I have had a lot to think about
It has been 18 years and nothing can change now without a doubt
The moment I said “I do” was the moment I started to regret being your spouse
I’m tired of going in circles, round and round
I daily yearn for the happiness I had once found
The happiness that swept my feet off the ground
I never thought I would be this hound
I never thought you would be this hound
