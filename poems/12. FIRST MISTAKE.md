One night
A girl’s night out had me drunk
I was still able to walk, as well as give a fuck
But the party got heated
Lost my friends in the crowd and moment
I was stranded
But God answered my prayer
And told me were to stare
A man was just standing there
Looking at me
Our eyes locked yet I felt so free
I didn’t know what came over me
I was supposed to call my husband but I did not
This man came towards me and walked me to his car
I told him directions to my house
He insisted we go to his place since it wasn’t far
The chemistry was real I could feel it
It was more real just like his hand that brushed my thigh
Morning was drawing nigh
Our body temperatures were high
We had arrived at his place and were about to go inside
My phone rang, it was my husband
At that moment, I was so ashamed that the wife in me had died
I forced this man to drive me home
I showed him my wedding ring and told him this was wrong
Reluctantly, he tagged along and dropped me home
