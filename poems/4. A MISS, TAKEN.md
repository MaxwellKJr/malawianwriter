I had everything I ever wanted
But only for a moment
God giveth
And God taketh away
It’s hard going through this long winter
With this unhealing splinter

I had everything I ever wanted
But only for a moment
What has followed has been nothing but torment
I hit the jackpot and somehow lost the token
I suffocate and choke on my own breath
I’m broken and he is not shaken
I wish I had accepted his friend 18 years ago
Before I had made a choice that will forever leave me, a miss taken, mistaken
