At night I would take my phone and talk to this man from the bar
At night things got heated
At night I neglected my husband as he watched his game
At night I yearned for this man’s texts rather than my husband’s arms
At night emotions rise
At night we are more capable of doing something stupid
No wonder we find suffocated necks in the morning
And lifeless bodies on overdosed beds
At night I was never thinking
At night I was another man’s girl though we never met
At night I was a cheater and I regretted it the next morning
At night I forgot my regrets and went back to my second love
At night I was a flirt machine accommodating anything
At night I felt like a teenager again
At night we are more capable of doing something stupid
At night we feast on cupid, expressing our feelings for anyone
That’s how we slowly kill our perfect relationships
Simple thoughts of someone else and how they sleep
At night I saw this man as my potential husband
At night I was never conflicted of my actions and that was wrong
One night my husband grabbed my phone and that’s what started it all
