He said I was like, “A lily among thorns”  
A phrase he took from Song of Songs  
And his actions always showed it  
Even if we went through some storms  
We slowly built our home  
On a foundation of friendship and love

“You are like a lily among thorns” he could whisper  
My emotions would boil up  
My love for him grew bigger  
It was never tough and he was all about love  
He was never sinister  
His face alone could minister  
To me, and make me fall deeper  
In the pit in his arms, slowly drowning me  
With kindness and love  
I was a lucky lily picked up by a dove
